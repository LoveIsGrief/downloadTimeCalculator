downloadTimeCalculator
======================

[Webpage](https://loveisgrief.github.io/downloadTimeCalculator/) to calculate how long it will take to download a file


# Development stuff

For now grunt isn't there so you will have to issue some commands to start developing:

```sh
npm install -g coffee bower # To compile the coffee and install needed libs with bower
bower install
```

And to display the page you'll need to run `coffee -c calculator.coffee` each time you edit the angular controller.
